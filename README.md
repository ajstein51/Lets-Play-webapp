## Project Description
This is a webapp that allows users to find group members for different games.
Games can be pickup basketball, videogames, and dungeons and dragons.

## Final Deliverable 
Our end goal is a webapp that allows someone to find others in a targetted interest. This can be from a variety of subjects from sports, games, hobbies, and anything inbetween. Along with that we hope to implement popular social media APIs to help seemlessly connect people with eachother from the webapp (such as adding steam connection). The number one goal is to allow easy access to find people near you with the same interest.
